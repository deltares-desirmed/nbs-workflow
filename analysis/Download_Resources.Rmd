You can download all the geospatial data used in this tutorial from the provided link. The data includes two formats: Geopackage for vector data and GeoTIFF for raster data, both of which you will need to follow along with the tutorial. For your convenience, I have provided the download links in each chapter and sub-chapter. 

### Vector

- [Sreepur](https://github.com/Ohm-Np/R_tutorial/raw/refs/heads/master/data/vector/sreepur.gpkg)
- [Protected Areas](https://github.com/Ohm-Np/R_tutorial/raw/refs/heads/master/data/vector/protected_areas.gpkg)

### Raster
