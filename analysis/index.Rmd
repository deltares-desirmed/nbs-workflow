Nature-based solutions (NbS) offer a transformative approach to addressing environmental challenges, leveraging the power of ecosystems to reduce vulnerabilities while enhancing resilience. This guide aims to walk you through a step-by-step workflow for creating and implementing NbS portfolios tailored to various regions. By combining advanced geospatial tools, data preprocessing techniques, and detailed impact chain assessments, we provide a structured pathway to identify opportunities and design interventions rooted in nature.

This project focuses on the development of region-specific NbS portfolios that align with local environmental, social, and economic contexts. The workflow outlined here helps us understand key factors like flood exposure, ecosystem connectivity, and demographic dynamics, enabling a science-driven approach to planning. Through this comprehensive guide, youâ€™ll explore how integrating data from platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) and desktop GIS software facilitates efficient analysis and meaningful insights, empowering decision-makers to tackle climate risks and implement solutions at scale.
